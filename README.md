# QuickFaaS Essentials ‚òÅÔ∏è

QuickFaaS is a multi-cloud interoperability desktop tool targeting cloud-agnostic functions development and FaaS deployments. QuickFaaS substantially improves developers' productivity, flexibility and agility when creating serverless solutions to different cloud providers **without requiring the installation of provider-specific software**. 

The proposed cloud-agnostic approach enables developers to reuse their serverless functions in multiple cloud providers with **no need to rewrite code**. This solution aims to minimize vendor lock-in in FaaS platforms by increasing the portability of serverless functions, which will, therefore, encourage developers and organizations to target different vendors in exchange for a functional benefit.

> **Note**  
> - QuickFaaS was originally developed within the context of a Master‚Äôs degree dissertation titled "_Characterizing and Providing Interoperability to
FaaS Platforms_", at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL), Lisboa, Portugal.

In terms of code development, this repository includes the uniform programming model for authentication and FaaS deployments, together with the cloud-agnostic libraries. We also provide an [evaluation](evaluation) in the form of Excel spreadsheets that validates the proposed solution by measuring the impact of a cloud-agnostic approach on the function's performance, when compared to a cloud-non-agnostic one.

Be sure to check out the [_wiki_](https://github.com/Pexers/quickfaas-essentials/wiki) page for more information regarding the usage of cloud-agnostic libraries.
